### Data Sources 

Crime Statistics Data: The core dataset for this analysis is the "2017-crime-stats_Data.csv" file, which includes comprehensive details on crime statistics from various states.

### Tools

- Power BI â€“ (Used for Creating Reports and Visualizations)

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved analyzing the 2017 Crime Stats data to address key questions such as:

1. What are the top 5 states with the highest number of reported crimes?
2. How does performance vary across different geopolitical regions?
3. How do crime rates differ from state to state?

### Result & Findings 

#### Top 5 States with the Highest Crime Rates

Lagos State reports the highest number of crimes, with a total of 50,975 incidents. It is followed by Abia State, which has recorded 12,408 crimes. The Federal Capital Territory, Kano State, and Delta State each report at least 500 crimes, highlighting substantial criminal activity in these areas.

#### Crime Distribution by Geo-Political Region
Among the geo-political regions, the South West has the highest crime rate, with a total of 61,000 incidents. This is followed by the South East with 22,000 crimes, and the South South with 16,000 crimes. The North Central region reports 15,000 crimes, while the North West has 12,000. The North East has the lowest crime rate, with 8,000 incidents.

### Conclusion

The analysis of crime statistics across various states and geo-political regions highlights notable disparities in crime rates. Lagos State, with the highest number of reported crimes, indicates a critical need for focused interventions in this region. Geographically, the South West exhibits the highest overall crime rates, while the North East reports the lowest. These observations emphasize the need for region-specific strategies to effectively tackle crime. Recognizing these regional differences allows for more efficient resource allocation and the development of targeted crime prevention measures tailored to each area's unique needs. Further investigation into the factors driving these disparities could offer deeper insights for enhancing public safety and formulating effective crime reduction policies.
